## Account Hierarchy

Accounts can be organized into a hierarchy using parent-child relationships. Summary accounts aggregate balances from their child accounts.

```
1000 - Assets (Summary)
├── 1100 - Current Assets (Summary)
│   ├── 1110 - Cash
│   ├── 1120 - Accounts Receivable
│   └── 1130 - Inventory
└── 1200 - Fixed Assets (Summary)
    ├── 1210 - Equipment
    └── 1220 - Accumulated Depreciation
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account Number Conventions">
    Use a consistent numbering scheme:
    - 1xxx - Assets
    - 2xxx - Liabilities
    - 3xxx - Equity
    - 4xxx - Revenue
    - 5xxx - Expenses
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account Deactivation">
    Instead of deleting accounts, deactivate them. This preserves historical data while preventing new transactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Balance Verification">
    Regularly verify that total debits equal total credits across your chart of accounts using the Trial Balance report.
