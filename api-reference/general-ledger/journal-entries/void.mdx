## Void vs. Reverse

| Action | Use Case | Effect |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Void** | Entry was made in error and should not have existed | Marks entry as voided, reverses balance impact |
| **Reverse** | Entry was correct at the time but needs to be undone | Creates a new reversing entry with audit trail |

Choose **Void** when the original entry was a mistake. Choose **Reverse** when you need to undo a legitimate transaction.
