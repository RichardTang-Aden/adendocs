## Overview

Bank Reconciliation allows you to match bank statement transactions with your general ledger entries to ensure your books accurately reflect your bank account balances.

## Key Features

- **Statement-based Reconciliation**: Import or manually enter bank statement details
- **Transaction Matching**: Match GL transactions to bank transactions
- **Adjustment Tracking**: Track bank and book adjustments
- **Approval Workflow**: Multi-step workflow from draft to approved
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of reconciliation activities

## Reconciliation Workflow

```
Draft → In Progress → Completed → Approved
                 ↓
              Voided
```

| `Draft` | Initial state, entering statement details |
| `In Progress` | Actively matching transactions |
